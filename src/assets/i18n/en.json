    "q2": "Excellent gym. The cleanliness of the facilities. Machines in optimal condition, all working, unlike other gyms that put up 'under repair' signs. The coaches are always there to support you. You tell them what you want to achieve, and they design the routines for you, guiding you every step of the way during your process. Good vibes and a very good atmosphere!! I highly recommend it." ,
    "q3": "The best gym. As soon as I saw the place, I was enchanted by the tidiness, the cleanliness, the spaces, the lighting, but what truly stands out is the staff, from the receptionists who are lovely, to the excellent trainers, always ready to explain the routine and correct your technique. Finding this place has been the best experience I've had. I've been here for 1 month, and luckily, I made the excellent decision to pay for the annual plan. Omnia has become my favorite part of the day." ,
